Task C: Product Package Counter
You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. 
Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

START
    counter = O
   
    FUNCTION counterPlusTwo(parameter_value)
        RETURN parameter_value + 2

    FUNCTION isScanned(packageId)
        Get a list of produc's Ids that were previously scanned from a data store // csv, db, textfile, etc
        Check if packageId is in the list
        IF packageId is in the list
            RETURN true
        ELSE
            ADD the current packageId in the data store
            RETURN false


    Wait for an package scanned signal
    WHEN the signal appears CALL isScanned() function with the package's id as parameter

    IF isScanned() returns false
        counter = counterPlusTwo(counter)
        PRINT the current counter value
        IF counter == 50
            PRINT "The container is full. You should take another empty container!"
    ELSE
        PRINT "This package has already been scanned. Try another one!"
